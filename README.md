irc_client
==========

Basic (I can't overestate how basic) command line IRC client.

Written as more of a proof of concept and to test sockets than an actual desire for a working IRC client.

If there's time I'll clean it up.

Written for Python 3.4

Usage: 
./program.py --server localhost --user noob
